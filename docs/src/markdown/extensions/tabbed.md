# Tabbed

## Overview

Tabbed provides a syntax to easily add tabbed Markdown content. Tabs follow the Admonition and Details style blocks, but
use the `===` token to distinguish itself.

```
=== "Tab 1"
    Markdown **content**.

    Multiple paragraphs.

=== "Tab 2"
    More Markdown **content**.

    - list item a
    - list item b
```

This will yield tabbed Markdown content:

=== "Tab 1"
    Markdown **content**.

    Multiple paragraphs.

=== "Tab 2"
    More Markdown **content**.

    - list item a
    - list item b

Tabs sets are created from consecutive tab blocks, but in the rare case that you want to follow two separate tab sets
right after each other, you can explicitly mark the start of a new tab set with `!`:

```
=== "Tab 1"
    Markdown **content**.

    Multiple paragraphs.

=== "Tab 2"
    More Markdown **content**.

    - list item a
    - list item b

===! "Tab A"
    Different tab set.

=== "Tab B"
    ```
    More content.
    ```
```

Which should yield two tab sets.

=== "Tab 1"
    Markdown **content**.

    Multiple paragraphs.

=== "Tab 2"
    More Markdown **content**.

    - list item a
    - list item b

===! "Tab A"
    Different tab set.

=== "Tab B"
    ```
    More content.
    ```
